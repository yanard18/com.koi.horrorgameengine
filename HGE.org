* Project
1. If any change requested, requester must offer an alternative idea.
2. User documentation should ve written integrated to development of the project.
3. Code must be documentad as well via [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments][documentation-commenting]].
4. First viable version must be implemented for Singleplayer & FPS


** Project Summary
Horror Game Engine is a game development kit primarly designed for FPS games that let developers develop
horror games without any programming however still extendible for programmers as well.

* Requirements

** Functional Requirements

- Game Effect Manager
- Sound Engine
- Trigger Mechanic
- Scene Loader
- Tetris Inventory
- Single Inventory
- Flashlight
- Battery Power System
- Cameras (CCTV like)
- Doors
- Camera like HUD
- Head-Bob system
- FPS Player Movement
- Behaviour Tree
- AI Builder
- Quest System
- Puzzle System
- Inspect
- Interaction
- Hiding
- Options Menu
- Input System
- Dialogue System
- Cutscene Manager
- Shop System
- Health System
- Drag System

** Optional Functional Requirements
- TPS Mechanic
- Procedural Asset Placement
- Procedural Environment Generation

*** Player Movement
1. Jump
2. Crouch
3. Acceleration and Deacceleration
4. Slope Climb Configuration
5. Slap Movement
6. Run
7. Stamina
8. Prone
9. Head Bob
10. Lag Camera Movement
11. Customizable FPS Hand

*** Dialogue System
1. Different languages support
*** Sound Engine
Analyze great sound engines from other projects like Gta V source code or FMOD Unity asset
1. Atmoshperic Sound
2. Object Pooling for spawning audio emitters
3. Alternative method to find audio cues end emit audio on them instead of spawning from pool 
*** Doors
1. Physic base doors
2. Control door with mouse movement
3. Classic interact-open doors

** Non-Functional Requirements
1. Interfaces must provide optional usages. I.e., if sound engine prefer dynamic audio cue spawn, also add
   alternative functions to run audio cues on already placed audio componenst (non dynamic spawn)
2. Each game system must be usable and configurable without any need of programming however systems must be extendible
   for programmers who wants to extend the code.
3. Different systems should share similar UI interfaces to remove duplication and increase consistency.
4. Use Unity's New UI toolkit for both main menu UI and custom editor UI.
5. Apply Unit Testing

* Project Risk Matrix
- R0: Can not found royalty free sound assets

  
* Naming Conventions

** Git Structure
1. Use master branch only when the feature is fully complete and safe (HAHA what's unsafe in c#???)
2. Main branch is =master=.
3. Second branch is =master/develop=, behave as a safe layer before pushing fetures to master.
4. Third branch is =develop/feature=, for each future use a separate feature branch.

1. Commits must be atomic.
2. Each commit name must be written in impretive mood.

** Code Convention
In general follow [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions][.NET Common C# Conventions]]
For naming convention follow [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names][.NET Naming Conventions]]
